    <p>Can you "tear" for me?</p>
    <blockquote><em>Hi, I had a bad and I want to collect photos of people "tearing" for me. Can you submit a photo\selfie of you "tearing"?You don't have to show your whole face in the picture
        and you don't have to cry. The most important part is "tear" dripping along the cheek. I have several example pictures in the post for your reference. Please make sure it
        is the picture of yourself not from the Internet. Please make sure it is the picture of yourself not from the Internet.The eligible photos will get bonus of 0.75D each. Thank

  <p>Work activity that can't yet be fully automated by computers remains as a task for
    the human body to complete in the role of an instrument. This is the "remainder"
    - the work that remains. Examined in total isolation the "remainder" can
    only give a hint or a gesture at larger projects and larger goals. Mechanical
    Turk is an inventory these "remainders" - each HIT is a clue that points at a
    larger business task, but so far removed from its proper context that it that
    can't ever be correctly understood.
  </p>

  <p>Odd Odd Jobs is an inventory of remainders, filtered out from thousands of HITS
    on the basis of their strangeness, representativeness or cheapness. Every day,
    my script downloads job descriptions and titles from all Mechanical Turk postings,
    and then, using simple word frequency analysis, attempts to find the job postings
    that look least like other postings, or most like other postings. In addition,
    the program finds the most frequently used imperative verbs in the job titles
    - these are the things that the workers must do, like "transcribe" or "write"
    or "identify", and they represent, non-scientifically, what computers
    can't yet accomplish. The project is therefore an index of data remainders, and
    a vague attempt to understand what particular computational failings lead to
    the business needs for the jobs to exist at all.</p>

  <!-- SURVEY TIME -->

  <p>Every day <em>Odd Odd Jobs</em> offers a glimpse at what's happening in the world
    of outsourced human automation. But, the list it generates is itself the product
    of an automated process, and can't ever provide a complete view of the data-entry
    landscape.</p>

  <p>In the summer of 2014, <a href="http://www.eamonabraham.com/" target="_blank">Eamon O'Connor</a> and
    I conducted a survey on Mechanical Turk about data entry jobs. I've included
    the survey below, with one of the notable responses:</p>

  <hr>
  <p><em>We are conducting a short survey about your experiences working in data-entry jobs. Please answer the questions below, in as much detail as possible.</em>
  </p>

  <p><strong>1. Tell us about the company you worked for. What did the company do? Where were they located? Was it a temp agency?</strong>
    <br>Wordium Data Work, Coimbatore, India. It is a permanent agency which works on
    captcha typing, image transcription and captcha software provider.</p>

  <p><strong>2. What was your job title, if you had one?</strong>
    <br>Job title: Captcha typer. </p>

  <p><strong>3. How long did you work there?</strong>
    <br>14 months I worked.  </p>

  <p><strong>4. Walk us through all the steps you had to do to enter one piece of data.</strong>
    <br>I need to type the captchas that is shown above. Screen contains one image section
    and one text field section. I need to type the captcha on the text field. I anyone
    image i feel hard to recognise it is possible to skip that image. If I continuously
    skip for 7 times then it will block me for 3 minutes. We do captcha typing in
    a software called "Captcha typer v1.3".</p>

  <p><strong>5. List the data fields you had to enter.</strong>
    <br>It contains only one field to type. Screen contains one image section and one
    text field section. I need to type the captcha on the text field. Image contains
    only single line captchas only. Captchas are one or two words only not more than
    two words came. </p>

  <p><strong>6. How long did it take to enter each piece of data?</strong>
    <br>4 - 10 seconds only not more than that.</p>

  <p><strong>7. How many data points did you enter?</strong>
    <br>At a time, I enter one data captcha only. Screen contains one text field only.
    So I type one data point on single strike.</p>

  <p><strong>8. Describe one piece of data you entered, if you can remember.</strong>
    <br>"IsL54T" this is one type of word which is in the image. I think you know about
    captchas so no need to explain on how to enter it.</p>

  <p><strong>9. Describe anything that struck you about the data you were entering.</strong>
    <br>Many time I struck without knowing. So I used "skip" option on that time. </p>

  <p><strong>10. Did you come up with any systems to make the data entry easier or more enjoyable?</strong>
    <br>I always give break for every 30 minutes. So downs some stress on work load.</p>

  <p><strong>11. What was going on in your life at the time? How old were you? Were you working multiple jobs?</strong>
    <br>I now only finished my college. My age is 21. I am searching for job. Till now
    I am selected in anything. So I am working on Mturk for part-time. To earn some
    money for my family and for my pocket money. </p>

  <p><strong>12. Did anything unusual happen during your time doing data entry?</strong>
    <br>Yes, unusual such as internet connection failure, image broken, and sometimes
    software becomes not responding and sometimes software suddenly closed without
    any reason. </p>

  <p><strong>13. Did you enter the data accurately? What happened if/when you made mistakes?</strong>
    <br>I have accuracy of 92%. If I made wrong it will count after I reaching 10th mistake
    it will automatically block me for 15 minutes.</p>

  <p><strong>14. Do you feel you benefited from your time in data entry?</strong>
    <br>No not I benefitted from doing that job but it give some relief on paying my
    college fees. However I learned many thing such as time management. my efficiency,
    work experience and finally some informations about company that is how it getting
    projects and also I know about openings in data entry is vast.</p>

  <p><strong>15. What were the most frustrating aspects of the job?</strong>
    <br>Need to work for 5 hours continuously for 6 six days (sunday holiday) because
    of that many times I had back pain and there is no snacks time or food court.
    So some times make me feel hungry and not to work.</p>

  <p><strong>16. What is your dream job?</strong>
    <br>I doesn't have any dream job. I have only goal that whatever work I do, I have
    thought that need to achieve the highest rank quickly.</p>

  <p><strong>17. How, in general, do you feel about data entry?</strong>
    <br>Data entry is not bad work. These jobs are also interesting jobs only. Many of
    them not realising that. I realise this after starting work in MTurk.</p>
