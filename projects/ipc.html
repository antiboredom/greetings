  <h2>The Intergovernmental Panel on <del>Climate Change</del> Capitalism</h2>

  <p><a href="http://intergovernmentalpaneloncapitalism.org" target="_blank">Launch Project</a>
  </p>

  <p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, founded by the United Nations in
    1988, is the "leading international body for the assessment of climate change".
    The organization is tasked with assessing and synthesizing (but not producing)
    research around climate change. Every few years it publishes a series of comprehensive
    reports on the current state of climate change research and knowledge.</p>

  <p>In 2007, the Nobel Peace Prize was jointly awarded to Al Gore and the IPCC "for
    their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate
    change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract
    such change."</p>

  <p><a href="http://tegabrain.com/" target="_blank">Tega Brain</a> and I have embarked
    on an ambitious project to edit all material published by the IPCC: through a
    series of automated procedures we replace every instance of the phrase "climate
    change" with the word "capitalism". <a href="http://intergovernmentalpaneloncapitalism.org"
    target="_blank">The Intergovernmental Panel on Capitalism</a> is a fictional world
    whose foundation is a one-line joke taken to its extreme conclusion. It is
    also a place to ask how international environmental discourse might directly
    engage with the overwhelming tension between environmental agendas and economic
    priorities.

  </p>

  <p>We start our systematic process with the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5):
    5000 pages of text split into four subreports. We used Adobe Acrobat for the
    find/replace.

    <p>Afterwards we printed and bound our modified reports.</p>

    <p>The edited reports contain a wealth of useful information and insight about capitalism.</p>

    <p>Next, we downloaded the entire IPCC website using a tool called <a href="https://www.httrack.com/" target="_blank">HTTRACK</a>, and
      the did the find/replace using SED.</p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>Not fully satisfied, I wrote a python script that does find/replace in images,
      using the open source optical character recognition tool tesseract.</p>

    </p>

    <p>Finally, I wrote another python script that does find/replace in video. First,
      the script transcribes audio and extracts timestamps for the searched word.
      Then, it creates a new audio track by overdubbing the found words with the
      desired replacement. In this case we used instances of the word "capitalism"
      extracted from the audiobook version of Piketty's "Capital in the Twenty-First Century."
      I ran the script on all 104 videos in the IPCC's YouTube channel. Many of these
      are videos clearly meant for internal use.</p>

    <p>I then made a supercut of all the instances where a replacement happened.</p>

    <p>In this project, the IPCC's organizational materials and output become a canvas
      onto which I can project my own fantasy. The fantasy is timid in nature: the
      fictional world we are building is not a utopia where private property is abolished
      - instead it is a light reform - all that has changed is word; the hopeless
      rush towards apocalyptic self-destruction remains intact. The exuberance I
      feel when browsing the fictional website and watching hours of fictional video
      quickly turns to vertigo.</p>

    <p>The project will only truly be complete when we have made a full replica of the
      IPCC offices, and enlisted an international team of scientists and policy makers
      to study the deleterious effects of global capitalism.</p>

    <p>In the words of the Nobel Committee: "Action is necessary now, before capitalism
      moves beyond man's control."</p>
