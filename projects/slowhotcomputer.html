  <p>Slow Hot Computer is a website that makes your computer run slow and hot. Use it
    at work to decrease your productivity.</p>

  <!-- <p>Workplace sabotage has long been a tactic of resistance. Employed by the luddites,______other examples____. It seems it has fallen off recently</p> -->

  <p>[ADD GIF & DESCRIPTION OF WHAT MAKES COMPUTER SLOW]</p>

  <p>Slow Hot Computer accomplishes two things: it makes the user's computer run slowly
    to the point of being almost unusable, but falls short of actually crashing the
    computer. [thus allowing] This allows the user to continue working but severely
    hampers their productivity. This type of action provides a venue for resistance
    that is less confrontational, and therefore safer, than full out strike or refusal
    to work. Bosses and managers call acts like these "time theft".</p>

  <p>An additional benefit of Slow Hot Computer is that it makes the user's computer
    consume more energy, thus running up the electricity bill of their workplace.</p>

  <!-- <p>Perhaps ironically, the NYPD employed this technique recently with their work stoppage....</p> -->

  <p>Slow Hot Computer is a fully functioning prototype. But more importantly it's a
    conceptual gesture that modernizes an old tactic. It's just one, my, implementation
    of a procedure that could have any number of implementations. For example, instead
    of running Slow Hot Computer, a user could intentionally install malware on their
    work computer.</p>
