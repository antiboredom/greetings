  <p>Slow Hot Computer is a website that makes your computer run slow and hot. Use it
    at work to decrease your productivity.</p>

  <!-- <p>Workplace sabotage has long been a tactic of resistance. Employed by the luddites,______other examples____. It seems it has fallen off recently</p> -->

  <p>The site works by running "processor intensive tasks", that is, it downloads a hidden
    image file over and over again until the user's computer slows to a near halt.
    To test the project's effectiveness, I employed a service called Peek, which
    offers free user testing. Here's a video of one of the tests:</p>

  <p>Slow Hot Computer accomplishes two things. First, it makes the user's computer
    run slowly to the point of being almost unusable, but falls short of actually
    crashing the computer. This allows the user to continue working but severely
    hampers their productivity, an action that provides a venue for resistance that
    is less confrontational, and therefore safer, than full out strike or refusal
    to work. Bosses and managers call acts like these <a href="http://www.epaysystems.com/facts-stats-employee-time-theft/"
    target="_blank">"time theft"</a>.</p>

  <p>Second, Slow Hot Computer makes the user's computer consume more energy, thus running
    up their employer's electricity bill.</p>

  <p>Employers increasingly outsource their labor needs to exploited workers, to automated
    systems and algorithms, or to systems which are semi-automated but still rely
    on human labor (such as Mechanical Turk). The same tools and methodologies that
    lead to repressive environments can be used, in turn, for actions and gestures
    of resistance. With this project I am beginning to explore how we might outsource and automate
    resistance, how to resist algorithmically.</p>


  <!-- <p>Perhaps ironically, the NYPD employed this technique recently with their work stoppage....</p> -->

  <p>Slow Hot Computer is a fully functioning prototype. But more importantly it's a
    conceptual gesture that modernizes an old tactic. It's just one implementation
    of a procedure that could be realized in any number of implementations. For example,
    instead of running Slow Hot Computer, a user could intentionally install malware
    on their work computer.</p>
