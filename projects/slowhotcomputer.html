  <p>Slow Hot Computer is a website that makes your computer run slow and hot. Use it
    at work to decrease your productivity.</p>

  <!-- <p>Workplace sabotage has long been a tactic of resistance. Employed by the luddites,______other examples____. It seems it has fallen off recently</p> -->

  <p>The site works by perpetually downloading an image file in the background.
    I employed a free service called Peek to test it out on a variety of of operating
    systems and browsers. Here's a video of one of the tests:</p>

  <p>Slow Hot Computer accomplishes two things: it makes the user's computer run slowly
    to the point of being almost unusable, but falls short of actually crashing the
    computer. This allows the user to continue working but severely hampers their
    productivity, an action that provides a venue for resistance that is less confrontational,
    and therefore safer, than full out strike or refusal to work. Bosses and managers
    call acts like these <a href="http://www.epaysystems.com/facts-stats-employee-time-theft/"
    target="_blank">"time theft"</a>.</p>

  <p>An additional benefit of Slow Hot Computer is that it makes the user's computer
    consume more energy, thus running up their employer's electricity bill.</p>

  <p>Employers increasingly outsource their labor needs to exploited workers, to automated
    systems and algorithms, or to systems which are semi-automated but still rely
    on human labor (such as Mechanical Turk). The same tools and methodologies that
    lead to repressive environments can be used, in turn, for actions and gestures
    of resistance. We should begin to envision how to outsource and automate our
    resistance, how to resist algorithmically.</p>


  <!-- <p>Perhaps ironically, the NYPD employed this technique recently with their work stoppage....</p> -->

  <p>Slow Hot Computer is a fully functioning prototype. But more importantly it's a
    conceptual gesture that modernizes an old tactic. It's just one implementation
    of a procedure that could be realized in any number of implementations. For example,
    instead of running Slow Hot Computer, a user could intentionally install malware
    on their work computer.</p>
