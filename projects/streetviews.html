  <p>Street Views is an inventory of physical locations whose legal, political or social

  <!-- <p>Street Views is an inventory of physical locations with remarkable but difficult&#45;to&#45;observe legal, political or social statuses.</p> -->

  <p>The project is split into three categories of locations: real estate assets owned
    by US congresspeople, privately owned and run prisons, and for-profit universities.</p>

  <p>To generate the animations, I capture screenshots from Google Streetview with CasperJS
    and SlimerJS, and then use FFMPEG to stitch the frames into videos.</p>
