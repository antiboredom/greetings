  <h2>Push Button for Self-Help</h2>
  <img src="images/selfhelp2.jpg">
  <p>Self-help is the descendent of a certain line of thought that arose out of the
    defeats, or perceived defeats of 60's: from these perceived defeats a movement
    gave up on transforming the political reality, turned inward and proclaimed that
    "You must be the change you wish to see in the world" (a statement falsely attributed
    to Gandhi). The turning inward, the imperative to "change the self" inevitably
    led to the commercialization of "changing the self" and today is fully realized
    in the industry of self-help.</p>

  <p>The ideology of self-help is therefore an ideology rooted in hopelessness, isolation
    and the status quo. But a kind of solipsistic, self-referential exuberance emerges
    from those roots.</p>

  <p>The story of the successful self-help author or motivational speaker is always
    one of self-becoming: the self-help speaker proves his credentials by narrating
    his personal journey of becoming a successful motivational speaker. "I am successful
    because I have become successful at being successful." This is the brilliant
    exuberance of tautology: the thing that makes itself. People turn to motivational
    speakers for help on how to be successful, how to be happy, but motivational
    speakers are most really qualified to instruct on how to be successful at being
    successful motivational speakers. And so, the true, ultimate end-game for any
    reader of self-help is to in fact become a self-help author.

  <p>I downloaded a 10gb torrent of self-help audiobooks: <a href="http://kickass.to/success-party-pack-the-biggest-collection-of-self-help-material-audiobooks-t87425.html">the Success Party Pack - The biggest collection of Self-Help material (audiobooks)</a>
  </p>

  <p>At the core of each book is a single word, a single transformative idea or signpost,
    adherence to which brings financial and sexual success. The trick is to to find
    the right word or idea, and then to apply it to all parts of your life. Using
    a tool I created called <a href="http://antiboredom.github.io/audiogrep" target="_blank">audiogrep</a>,
    I reduced each self-help book to its central idea, and then created this - a
    self-help box that I installed in the Stern School of Business at NYU:</p>
