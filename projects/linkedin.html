  <h2>3 Degrees of Separation from the Military-Industrial-Prison-Data-Surveillance State</h2>

    Some time ago, I started searching LinkedIn for keywords like "interrogation" and
    "surveillance". My initial thought was that I would find private organizations
    with ties to law enforcement and the military. I was surprised to discover that,
    in addition to showing matching organizations, LinkedIn was finding people. Here,
    for example, the search engine is offering to narrow my search to "People with
    Interrogation skills".

  <p>As I started to click around on different profile pages I realized that, as long
    as they were within two or three degrees of separation from me, I had access
    to the profiles of professionals working in fields like law enforcement, private
    security, and military contracting. Like every other LinkedIn profile, these
    pages catalogued education, background experience, and relevant skill sets.</p>

  <p>LinkedIn's skill system is a social feature: you receive skill endorsements from
    other LinkedIn members. I love to imagine who is endorsing who for something
    like "interrogation" or "surveillance". Is it the interrogated? The surveilled?
    (It seems like the subject of an interrogation would be in the best position
    to make an authoritative endorsement about the interrogator's skill level.)</p>

  <p>But more remarkable than the act of endorsing someone for a skill like "asymmetrical
    warfare" or "weapons of mass destruction" is the feeling that on LinkedIn, all
    careers are basically on the same plane. There's a total dissociation between
    the application of a skill like interrogation (which can amount to torture) and
    the way that skill slots into a professional profile page on LinkedIn and helps
    build up a personal brand, the same way "photoshop" or "public speaking" might.
    It's quite interesting to see these different types of skills sitting so close
    to each other:</p>

  <p>The point here is not the cognitive dissonance between "counterterrorism" and "voice
    over", but the feeling that all these skills are abstracted away from their real-world
    application to a point where they become equivalent, interchangeable.</p>

  <p>I was also struck, of course, by my own proximity to people who are professional
    enforcers, interrogators, black ops experts and so on.</p>

  <p>Out of a curiousity to better understand that proximity, I wrote a script to scrape
    LinkedIn profile pages based on keyword searches like "homeland security" and
    "counterterrorism".</p>

  <p>Over a period of a three days I accumulated data from a few thousand profile pages,
    and then produced this: a map of profiles on LinkedIn within two or three degrees
    of separation from me who have received endorsements for the following skills:
    "surveillance", "homeland security", "counterterrorism", "interrogation", and
    "enforcement".</p>

  <p>The inner circle shows profiles with two degrees of separation from me (friends
    of friends), and the outer circle three degrees of separation. You can mouse
    over each image to learn more about that person, their skills, current job, and
    click for their full LinkedIn profile.</p>

  <p>I generally find it more useful to think about injustices like mass surveillance
    or mass incarceration as systemic problems demanding systemic solutions, rather
    than as composites of the individual actions and choices made by their institutional
    functionaries.</p>

  <p>But both are true â€“ the prison industrial complex, for example, operates through
    the coordination of laws, capital and labor that goes well beyond any individual
    prison guard, and at the same time there can be no prison industrial complex
    without prison guards, administrators and the various service providers whose
    on-the-ground involvement make the whole thing real.</p>

  <p>I do not present this graph with the aim of singling out any individual for participating
    in the military industrial complex, or the surveillance state etc., but simply
    to show how these systems are supported by the banality of their professionalization.
    And, just as a "downhill skiing" skill endorsement can sit comfortably next to
    a "biosurveillance" skill endorsement, a career in "dignitary protection" has
    been rendered as equivalently unremarkable as a career in web development.</p>

    Shortly after I began this project, I started receiving LinkedIn invitations like
