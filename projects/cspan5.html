  <p>C-SPAN 5 is an automated C-SPAN re-editing program that condenses hour-long C-SPAN
    programming to 1-2 minute clips. Every day the script downloads a C-SPAN video,
    transcribes the audio, and then creates a new video containing top keywords from
    the transcription. The finished videos are then posted to YouTube and Twitter.</p>

  <p>Each video is completely auto-generated: I have no direct control of which keywords
    are selected or how the final edits come out.</p>

  <p>Encompassing an impossibly large corpus of political spectacle, talking points
    and general tedium, what follows is CSPAN rendered in its most concentrated form:</p>

  <p>The transparent release of information can itself be an obfuscating strategy. CSPAN
    gives us direct access to the tedium of governing, but the gesture of transparency
    is nullified by the sheer size of the corpus. Procedural reduction can serve
    as a kind of counter strategy.</p>

  <!-- <p>With this project I'm interested in reducing this corpus to its most concentrated form.</p> -->

  <!-- <p>Generally speaking, I'm interested in exploring techniques for shrinking down large inventories, lists, and bodies of texts. Reductions, especially programmatic ones, allow -->
  <!--   us to make unexpected discoveries and can potentially reveal hidden truths about corpora. And, equally important for me, is the research process that goes into rendering something -->
  <!--   impossibly large somewhat legible.</p> -->
  <!--  -->
  <!-- <p>I think this is particularly worthwhile when dealing with governmental corpora, which are frequently illegible due to how massive they can be. Releasing information, even in -->
  <!--   the name of transparency, can itself be an obfuscating strategy. So, programmatic reduction is a kind of counter&#45;strategy.</p> -->
